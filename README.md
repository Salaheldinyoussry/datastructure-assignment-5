the evaluate method :
it accepts a single space expression also if spaces between operators and operands doesn't exist it will work just fine
if there is no space between an operand and the negative sign  before it it will consider the operand as negative one 

the infixtopostfix method:
the operand can be on these forms:
x1 + x2 *x3

-(a+b)--b

but  :   abc +v is not accepted


the expression can be like the following :
a--b  or
a+-b   or
a*-b
